### Introduction
>
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.  
For this project, the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  the goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page of their website, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### Methodolgy
>
Claculate the Probability\
Conduct A/B Test\
Conduct Logistic Regression

### Conclusion
>
The extra factors have no significant p-values, and none of the country factors have an impact on the conversion rate.We will therefore not reject the null and conclude that by there is not enough evidence to indicate that there is an interaction between the collected country and page that estimate whether or not a user will converts.

> Based on the information available, we do not have abundant proof in the bigger context to say that the new page results has more conversions than the old one.
