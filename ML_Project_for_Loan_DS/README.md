## Machine Learning Algoritm for Loan dataset

### Scope of Project:
Apply four different machine learning algorithm ( KNN, SVM, Descision Tree, Logistic Regression) to predict the Loan_status variable regarding to X group of variables
, that containes eight variables. The projects aim to exmaine the four different algorithm on the same set of variables to identify which algorithm gives high accuaracy.
Threee different evaluation matrecis are used to evaluate the accuracy of each algorithm hich they are Jaccard, F1 score and log loss.

### Project Out-put:
the decision tree algorithm is measured as the highest accuracy among the four algorithms based on F1 score. While logestic regression achive the highst score based on Jaccard evaluation matrix. It is also found that the best K value in KNN algorithm equal 7 and the built, trained by using this value.

### Technology used:
The whole analysis, data cleanin, model building, model training and evaluating are done by using Cognitive lab.ai that provided by IBM. The libraries used are Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scipy, Sklearn, pudotplus and graphviz.
