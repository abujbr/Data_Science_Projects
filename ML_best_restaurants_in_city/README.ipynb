    "### Problem background : \n",
    "Bangalore is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Karnataka. With a population of over 15 million (as of January 2016), Bangalore is the third largest city in India and 27th largest city in the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "The diversity of the cuisine available is reflective of the social and economic diversity of Bangalore. Roadside vendors, tea stalls, South Indian, North Indian, Muslim food, Chinese and Western fast food are all very popular in the city. Udupi restaurants, are very popular and serve predominantly vegetarian cuisine. The Chinese food and the Thai food served in most of the restaurants are can be customised to cater to the tastes of the Indian population. Bangalore can also be called a foodie's paradise because of its vast variety of foods and edibles with a touch of Bangalore's uniqueness and tradition"

    "Suppose i travel and keep changing places very frequently. This is very hectic and plus i get to experience very different types of environment, of which i donot have much knowledge about. In such situation, food can be an important factor for decided how you rate your trips and plus also recommmending it to the people. Food can also attract people around to world to try it out if it were to be the best. In such scenarios, we need to find the right place, at reasonable cost, to serve us the best possible way. So there are few questions that must be addresed, such as :\n",

    "4. Do the \"similar\" restaurants cost more ? if so, what speciality do that have ?\n",

    "To address such question, XXYZ company's manager decides to allocate this project to me not just to find out solutions to the questions but also build a system that can help in recommending new places based on their rankings compared to the previously visited by me.\n",

People could simply decide to look for a similar restaurant all the time because they are addicted to a specific category of food. People who rarely use restaurants would prefer to have the most rated restaurants nearby them and all this could be easily handed by our recommender system. So target for this project is basically everyone who is exploring different places or similar places. "

On the other hand, Computers are good at remembering things, and with Machine learning to its peak, it high time technology will by our personal guidence and help us personally based on our likes and dislikes. So people would care about this project as their personal assistance and success rate could certainly increase with time."

    "To find a solution to the questions and build a recommender model, we need data and lots of data. Data can answer question which are unimaginable and non answerable by humans because humans do not have the tendency to analyse such large dataset and produce analtics to find a solutions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose i want to find a restaurant, then logically, i need 3 things :\n",
    "1. Its geographical coordinates(latitide and longitude) to find our where exactly it is located.\n",
    "2. Population of the neighborhood where the restaurant is located.\n",
    "3. Average income of neighborhood to know how much is the restaurant worth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take a closer look at each of these :\n",
    "1. To access location of a restaurant, its Latitude and Longitude is to be known so that we can point at its coordinates and create a map displaying all the restaurants with its labels respectively.\n",
    "2. Population of a neighborhood is very important factor in determining a restaurant's growth and amount of customers who turn up to eat. Logically, the more the population of a neighborhood, the more people will be interested to walk openly into a restaurant and less the population, less number of people frequently visit a restaurant. Also if more people visit, better the restaurant is rated because it is accessed by different people with different taste. Hence is is very important factor.\n",
    "3. Income of a neighborhood is also very important factor as population was. Income is directly proportional to richness of a neighborhood. If people in a neighborhood earns more than an average income, then it is very much possible that they will spend more however not always true with very less probability. So an restaurant accessment is proportional to income of a neighborhood."
